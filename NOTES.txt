Questions.

If possible it would be good to have a fabic_copy character style for the fabric copy. Event if it does not have any style overrides.
Other wise I need to make some assumptions that will work on this book but may break going forward.

The bugs will need to have a character style applied to them hard to filter out the space from the embedded image.
